### Things to do this evening

- Refactor the 'getReminderValues' function. Split it apart to get the values then pass them onto another function to add them to the todolist array
- I need a hook to get to the item I need when deleting an item. The data-test attribute I am using doesnt work in its current form and the ID's are overlapping Maybe I need to redraw the list each time I add a new item?
- Style the table a little just so it actually looks like a proper table.
